# Azure Arc-enabled SQL Server supports Extended Security Updates

[!INCLUDE [sqlserver](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]

Azure Arc-enabled SQL Server supports Extended Security Updates for eligible products and licenses. For details, see [What are Extended Security Updates for SQL Server?](../end-of-support/sql-server-extended-security-updates.md).


## Extended Security Updates

Once [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] has reached the end of its support lifecycle, you can sign up for an Extended Security Update (ESU) subscription for your servers and remain protected for up to three years. When you upgrade to a newer version of [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], your ESU subscription is automatically canceled. When you [migrate to Azure SQL](/azure/azure-sql/migration-guides/), the ESU charges automatically stop but you continue to have access to the ESUs.
