# sqlcmd - use the utility

[!INCLUDE [sql-asdb-asdbmi-asa-pdw](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi-asa-pdw.md)]

The **sqlcmd** utility is a command-line utility for ad hoc, interactive execution of Transact-SQL (T-SQL) statements and scripts and for automating T-SQL scripting tasks. To use **sqlcmd** interactively, or to build script files to be run using **sqlcmd**, users must understand T-SQL. The **sqlcmd** utility is typically used in the following ways:

- Users enter T-SQL statements in a manner similar to working at the command prompt. The results are displayed at the command prompt. To open a Command Prompt window, enter `cmd` in the Windows search box and select **Command Prompt** to open. At the command prompt, type `sqlcmd` followed by a list of options that you want. For a complete list of the options that are supported by **sqlcmd**, see [sqlcmd utility](sqlcmd-utility.md).

- Users submit a **sqlcmd** job either by specifying a single T-SQL statement to execute, or by pointing the utility to a text file that contains T-SQL statements to execute. The output is directed to a text file, but can also be displayed at the command prompt.

- [SQLCMD mode](edit-sqlcmd-scripts-query-editor.md) in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) Query Editor.
- SQL Server Management Objects (SMO).
- SQL Server Agent CmdExec jobs.

## Typically used sqlcmd options

- Server option (`-S`) identifies the instance of [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] to which **sqlcmd** connects.

- Authentication options (`-E`, `-U`, and `-P`) specify the credentials that **sqlcmd** uses to connect to the instance of [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].

  > [!NOTE]  
  > The option `-E` is the default and does not need to be specified.

- Input options (`-Q`, `-q`, and `-i`) identify the location of the input to **sqlcmd**.

- The output option (`-o`) specifies the file in which **sqlcmd** is to put its output.

## Connect to the sqlcmd utility

- Connect to a default instance by using Windows Authentication to interactively run T-SQL statements:

  ```cmd
  sqlcmd -S <ComputerName>
  ```

  > [!NOTE]  
  > In the previous example, `-E` is not specified because it is the default and **sqlcmd** connects to the default instance by using Windows Authentication.

- Connect to a named instance by using Windows Authentication to interactively run T-SQL statements:

  ```cmd
  sqlcmd -S <ComputerName>\<InstanceName>
  ```

  or

  ```cmd
  sqlcmd -S .\<InstanceName>
  ```

- Connect to a named instance by using Windows Authentication and specifying input and output files:

  ```cmd
  sqlcmd -S <ComputerName>\<InstanceName> -i <MyScript.sql> -o <MyOutput.rpt>
  ```

- Connect to the default instance on the local computer by using Windows Authentication, executing a query, and having **sqlcmd** remain running after the query has finished running:

  ```cmd
  sqlcmd -q "SELECT * FROM AdventureWorks2022.Person.Person"
  ```

- Connect to the default instance on the local computer by using Windows Authentication, executing a query, directing the output to a file, and having **sqlcmd** exit after the query has finished running:

  ```cmd
  sqlcmd -Q "SELECT * FROM AdventureWorks2022.Person.Person" -o MyOutput.txt
  ```

- Connect to a named instance using [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Authentication to interactively run T-SQL statements, with **sqlcmd** prompting for a password:

  ```cmd
  sqlcmd -U MyLogin -S <ComputerName>\<InstanceName>
  ```

  > [!TIP]  
  > To see a list of the options that are supported by the **sqlcmd** utility run: `sqlcmd -?`.

## Run Transact-SQL statements interactively by using sqlcmd

You can use the **sqlcmd** utility interactively to execute T-SQL statements in a Command Prompt window. To interactively execute T-SQL statements by using **sqlcmd**, run the utility without using the `-Q`, `-q`, `-Z`, or `-i` options to specify any input files or queries. For example:

```cmd
sqlcmd -S <ComputerName>\<InstanceName>
```

When the command is executed without input files or queries, **sqlcmd** connects to the specified instance of [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], and then displays a new line with a `1>` followed by a blinking underscore that is named the **sqlcmd** prompt. The `1` signifies that this is the first line of a T-SQL statement, and the **sqlcmd** prompt is the point at which the T-SQL statement starts when you type it in.

At the **sqlcmd** prompt, you can type both T-SQL statements and **sqlcmd** commands, such as `GO` and `EXIT`. Each T-SQL statement is put in a buffer called the statement cache. These statements are sent to [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] after you type the `GO` command and press **Enter**. To exit **sqlcmd**, type `EXIT` or `QUIT` at the start of a new line.

To clear the statement cache, type `:RESET`. Typing **Ctrl+C** causes **sqlcmd** to exit. **Ctrl+C** can also be used to stop the execution of the statement cache after a `GO` command has been issued.

T-SQL statements that are entered in an interactive session can be edited by entering the `:ED` command and the **sqlcmd** prompt. The editor will open and, after editing the T-SQL statement and closing the editor, the revised T-SQL statement will appear in the command window. Enter `GO` to run the revised T-SQL statement.

## Quoted strings

Characters that are enclosed in quotation marks are used without any additional preprocessing, except that quotations marks can be inserted into a string by entering two consecutive quotation marks. [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] treats this character sequence as one quotation mark. (However, the translation occurs in the server.) Scripting variables aren't expanded when they appear within a string.

For example:

```cmd
sqlcmd
PRINT "Length: 5"" 7'";
GO
```

[!INCLUDE [ssResult](../../includes/ssresult-md.md)]

```output
Length: 5" 7'
```

## Strings that span multiple lines

**sqlcmd** supports scripts that have strings that span multiple lines. For example, the following `SELECT` statement spans multiple lines but is a single string executed when you press the **Enter** key after typing `GO`.

```sql
SELECT <First line>
FROM <Second line>
WHERE <Third line>;
GO
```

## Interactive sqlcmd example

This is an example of what you see when you run **sqlcmd** interactively.

When you open a Command Prompt window, there's one line similar to:

```output
C:\Temp\>
```

This means the folder `C:\Temp\` is the current folder, and if you specify a file name, Windows looks for the file in that folder.

Type **sqlcmd** to connect to the default instance of [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] on the local computer, and the contents of the Command Prompt window are as follows:

```cmd
C:\Temp>sqlcmd
1>
```

This means you've connected to the instance of [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] and **sqlcmd** is now ready to accept T-SQL statements and **sqlcmd** commands. The flashing underscore after the `1>` is the **sqlcmd** prompt that marks the location at which the statements and commands you type are displayed. Now, type `USE AdventureWorks2022` and press **Enter**, and then type `GO` and press **Enter**. The contents of the Command Prompt window are as follows:

```cmd
sqlcmd
USE AdventureWorks2022;
GO
```

[!INCLUDE [ssResult](../../includes/ssresult-md.md)]

```output
Changed database context to 'AdventureWorks2022'.
1>
```

When you press **Enter**, it signals **sqlcmd** to start a new line. Pressing **Enter** after you type `GO`, signals **sqlcmd** to send the `USE AdventureWorks2022` statement to the instance of [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. **sqlcmd** then returns a message to indicate that the `USE` statement completed successfully, and displays a new `1>` prompt as a signal to enter a new statement or command.

The following example shows what the Command Prompt window contains if you type a `SELECT` statement, a `GO` to execute the `SELECT`, and an `EXIT` to exit **sqlcmd**:

```sql
USE AdventureWorks2022;
GO
SELECT TOP (3) BusinessEntityID, FirstName, LastName
FROM Person.Person;
GO
```

[!INCLUDE [ssResult](../../includes/ssresult-md.md)]

```output
BusinessEntityID  FirstName  LastName
----------------- ---------- ------------
1                 Syed       Abbas
2                 Catherine  Abel
3                 Kim        Abercrombie
```

After you generate output, **sqlcmd** resets the **sqlcmd** prompt and displays `1>`. Type `EXIT` at the `1>` prompt, to exit the session. You can now close the Command Prompt window by typing another `EXIT` command.

## Create and query a SQL Server container

You can use **sqlcmd** (Go) to create a new instance of [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] in a container. **sqlcmd** (Go) exposes a `create` statement that allows you to specify a container image and [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] backup, to quickly create a [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] instance for development, debugging, and analysis purposes.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> You need a container runtime installed, such as [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), or [Podman](https://podman.io/).

The following command shows how to see all available options to create a new [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] container:

```cmd
sqlcmd create mssql --help
```

The following command creates a new [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] instance using the latest version of [!INCLUDE [sssql22-md](../../includes/sssql22-md.md)], then restores the Wide World Importers sample database:

```cmd
sqlcmd create mssql --accept-eula --tag 2022-latest --using https://github.com/Microsoft/sql-server-samples/releases/download/wide-world-importers-v1.0/WideWorldImporters-Full.bak
```

Once the [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] instance is created, you can use **sqlcmd** (Go) to manage and query it.

The following command confirms the version of the instance that was created:

```cmd
sqlcmd query "SELECT @@version"
```

The following command starts an interactive session with the instance that was created:

```cmd
sqlcmd query
```

The following command opens Azure Data Studio, and connects automatically to the database that was restored during the create process:

```cmd
sqlcmd open ads
```

The following command lists connection strings to be used to connect to the instance that was created:

```cmd
sqlcmd config connection-strings
```

The following command is used to remove the container when it is no longer needed:

```cmd
sqlcmd delete
```

## Run Transact-SQL script files using sqlcmd

You can use **sqlcmd** to execute database script files. Script files are text files that contain a mix of T-SQL statements, **sqlcmd** commands, and scripting variables. For more information about how to script variables, see [Use sqlcmd with Scripting Variables](./sqlcmd-use-scripting-variables.md). **sqlcmd** works with the statements, commands, and scripting variables in a script file in a manner similar to how it works with statements and commands that are entered interactively. The main difference is that **sqlcmd** reads through the input file without pause instead of waiting for a user to enter the statements, commands, and scripting variables.

There are different ways to create database script files:

- You can interactively build and debug a set of T-SQL statements in SQL Server Management Studio, and then save the contents of the Query window as a script file.

- You can create a text file that contains T-SQL statements by using a text editor, such as Notepad.

## Examples

### A. Run a script by using sqlcmd

Start Notepad, and type the following T-SQL statements:

```sql
USE AdventureWorks2022;
GO
SELECT TOP (3) BusinessEntityID, FirstName, LastName
FROM Person.Person;
GO
```

Create a folder named `MyFolder` and then save the script as the file `MyScript.sql` in the folder `C:\MyFolder`. Enter the following command at the command prompt to run the script and put the output in `MyOutput.txt` in `MyFolder`:

```console
sqlcmd -i C:\MyFolder\MyScript.sql -o C:\MyFolder\MyOutput.txt
```

[!INCLUDE [ssresult-md](../../includes/ssresult-md.md)]

```output
Changed database context to 'AdventureWorks2022'.
BusinessEntityID  FirstName  LastName
----------------- ---------- ------------
1                 Syed       Abbas
2                 Catherine  Abel
3                 Kim        Abercrombie
(3 rows affected)
```

### B. Use sqlcmd with a dedicated administrative connection

In the following example, **sqlcmd** is used to connect to a server that has a blocking problem by using the dedicated administrator connection (DAC).

```cmd
C:\Temp\>sqlcmd -S ServerName -A
1> SELECT session_id, blocking_session_id FROM `sys.dm_exec_requests` WHERE blocking_session_id <> 0;
2> GO
```

[!INCLUDE [ssResult](../../includes/ssresult-md.md)]

```output
session_id   blocking_session_id
-----------  --------------------`
62           64
(1 rows affected)
```

Use **sqlcmd** to end the blocking process.

```cmd
1> KILL 64;
2> GO
```

### C. Use sqlcmd to execute a stored procedure

The following example shows how to execute a stored procedure by using **sqlcmd**. Create the following stored procedure.

```sql
USE AdventureWorks2022;
GO

IF OBJECT_ID('dbo.ContactEmailAddress', 'P') IS NOT NULL
    DROP PROCEDURE dbo.ContactEmailAddress;
GO

CREATE PROCEDURE dbo.ContactEmailAddress (
    @FirstName NVARCHAR(50),
    @LastName NVARCHAR(50)
)
AS
SET NOCOUNT ON;

SELECT EmailAddress
FROM Person.Person
WHERE FirstName = @FirstName
    AND LastName = @LastName;

SET NOCOUNT OFF;
GO
```

At the **sqlcmd** prompt, enter the following:

```cmd
C:\Temp\sqlcmd
1> :Setvar FirstName Gustavo
1> :Setvar LastName Achong
1> EXEC dbo.ContactEmailAddress $(FirstName),$(LastName)
2> GO
EmailAddress
-----------------------------
gustavo0@adventure-works.com
```

### D. Use sqlcmd for database maintenance

The following example shows how to use **sqlcmd** for a database maintenance task. Create `C:\Temp\BackupTemplate.sql` with the following code.

```sql
USE master;
BACKUP DATABASE [$(db)] TO DISK='$(bakfile)';
```

At the **sqlcmd** prompt, enter the following code:

```cmd
C:\Temp\>sqlcmd
1> :connect <server>
Sqlcmd: Successfully connected to server <server>.
1> :setvar db msdb
1> :setvar bakfile C:\Temp\msdb.bak
1> :r C:\Temp\BackupTemplate.sql
2> GO
Changed database context to 'master'.
Processed 688 pages for database 'msdb', file 'MSDBData' on file 2.
Processed 5 pages for database 'msdb', file 'MSDBLog' on file 2.
BACKUP DATABASE successfully processed 693 pages in 0.725 seconds (7.830 MB/sec)
```

### E. Use sqlcmd to execute code on multiple instances

The following code in a file shows a script that connects to two instances. Notice the `GO` before the connection to the second instance.

```cmd
:CONNECT <server>\,<instance1>
EXEC dbo.SomeProcedure
GO
:CONNECT <server>\,<instance2>
EXEC dbo.SomeProcedure
GO
```

### E. Return XML output

The following example shows how XML output is returned unformatted, in a continuous stream.

```cmd
C:\Temp\>sqlcmd -d AdventureWorks2022
1> :XML ON
1> SELECT TOP 3 FirstName + ' ' + LastName + ', '
2> FROM Person.Person
3> GO
Syed Abbas, Catherine Abel, Kim Abercrombie,
```

### F. Use sqlcmd in a Windows script file

A **sqlcmd**command such as `sqlcmd -i C:\Temp\InputFile.txt -o C:\Temp\OutputFile.txt,` can be executed in a .bat file together with VBScript. In this case, don't use interactive options. **sqlcmd** must be installed on the computer that is executing the .bat file.

First, create the following four files in `C:\Temp`:

- C:\Temp\badscript.sql

    ```sql
    SELECT batch_1_this_is_an_error
    GO
    SELECT 'batch #2'
    GO
    ```

- C:\Temp\goodscript.sql

    ```sql
    SELECT 'batch #1';
    GO
    SELECT 'batch #2';
    GO
    ```

- C:\Temp\returnvalue.sql

    ```sql
    :exit(select 100)
    ```

- C:\Temp\windowsscript.bat

    ```bat
    @echo off

    echo Running badscript.sql
    sqlcmd -i badscript.sql -b -o out.log
    if not errorlevel 1 goto next1
    echo == An error occurred

    :next1

    echo Running goodscript.sql
    sqlcmd -i goodscript.sql -b -o out.log
    if not errorlevel 1 goto next2
    echo == An error occurred

    :next2
    echo Running returnvalue.sql
    sqlcmd -i returnvalue.sql -o out.log
    echo SQLCMD returned %errorlevel% to the command shell

    :exit
    ```

Then, at the command prompt, run `C:\Temp\windowsscript.bat`:

```cmd
C:\Temp\>windowsscript.bat
Running badscript.sql
== An error occurred
Running goodscript.sql
Running returnvalue.sql

SQLCMD returned 100 to the command shell
```

### G. Use sqlcmd to set encryption on Azure SQL Database

**sqlcmd** can be executed on a connection to [!INCLUDE [ssSDS](../../includes/sssds-md.md)] data on to specify encryption and certificate trust. Two **sqlcmd** options are available:

- The `-N` switch is used by the client to request an encrypted connection. This option is equivalent to the ADO.net option `ENCRYPT = true`.

- The `-C` switch is used by the client to configure it to implicitly the trust server certificate and not validate it. This option is equivalent to the ADO.net option `TRUSTSERVERCERTIFICATE = true`.

The [!INCLUDE [ssSDS](../../includes/sssds-md.md)] service doesn't support all the `SET` options available on a [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] instance. The following options throw an error when the corresponding `SET` option is set to `ON` or `OFF`:

- `SET ANSI_DEFAULTS`
- `SET ANSI_NULLS`
- `SET REMOTE_PROC_TRANSACTIONS`
- `SET ANSI_NULL_DEFAULT`

The following SET options don't throw exceptions but can't be used. They're deprecated:

- `SET CONCAT_NULL_YIELDS_NULL`
- `SET ANSI_PADDING`
- `SET QUERY_GOVERNOR_COST_LIMIT`

#### Syntax

The following examples refer to cases where SQL Server Native Client Provider settings include:

- `ForceProtocolEncryption = False`
- `Trust Server Certificate = No`

Connect using Windows credentials and encrypt communication:

```cmd
sqlcmd -E -N
```

Connect using Windows credentials and trust server certificate:

```cmd
sqlcmd -E -C
```

Connect using Windows credentials, encrypt communication and trust server certificate:

```cmd
sqlcmd -E -N -C
```

The following examples refer to cases where SQL Server Native Client Provider settings include:

- `ForceProtocolEncryption = True`
- `TrustServerCertificate = Yes`

Connect using Windows credentials, encrypt communication and trust server certificate:

```cmd
sqlcmd -E
```

Connect using Windows credentials, encrypt communication and trust server certificate:

```cmd
sqlcmd -E -N
```

Connect using Windows credentials, encrypt communication and trust server certificate:

```cmd
sqlcmd -E -C
```

Connect using Windows credentials, encrypt communication and trust server certificate:

```cmd
sqlcmd -E -N -C
```

If the provider specifies `ForceProtocolEncryption = True`, then encryption is enabled even if `Encrypt=No` in the connection string.
